Over the summer, I worked on designing and building the 2018 crowfunding campaign website with the fundraising platform CHIMP. I also initiated a user journey map for the campaign, participated in user testing for their newly published app <span id="italic">Arrival Advisor</span> and proposed design resarch on the acessibility of the UI. </div>

  <div class="text"><br><p id="title"> Process </p>In the early low and medium fidelity mockups, I explored different CTA's and hiearchy of information to figure out what best reflected a user experience for a genereal audience, business audience, a participant and a donator.  By being able to prototype with live code, an efficient loop of feedback from various audiences was used to improve the user experience. <br> While developing the in-campaign website, the most challenging aspect was to display funded figures from the CHIMP platform without an API document to reference. Therefore during this time, one of the biggest learning curves for me was to figure out how to hack at displaying accurate numbers for each group, individuals, organizations and the overall total. For the future, I would avoid using a seperate donation platform to avoid hindering a holsitic experience of the campaign website.  </div>

  <div class="in-progress-text"><p id="title">Art Direction/Branding </p> Using PeaceGeek's branded font Poppins - I chose to go with the boldest weight for the copy to stand out on visual assets - alongside a simple hashtag to promote social media engagement. A light to moderate treatment to photos was used to keep imagery relatable and to evoke as much emotion to the people the donations are going towards. Slightly expanding PeaceGeek's original orange and blue brand colours, we chose to keep colours throughout the campaign experience warm and inviting. Illustrations were mainly used to explain the steps of the campaign and to depict the actions or things that one could choose to give up as a participant.   </div>

  <div class="aa-text"><span id="aa-title">User Testing</span><br>Concurrently, I helped to work on the early stages of Arrival Advisor by PeaceGeeks - an app that aims to simplify the transition of a refugee into Canada by prompting personal questionnaires to curate resources for their specific needs. By condensing the need to read a 200+ page Canada's newcomer settlement guide, the app strives to be the best and easiest all-in-one resource for refguees. At the end of my internship term, I discovered new insights on approaching user testing for a on native English speaking audience and prompted new design changes based off the user testing session. </div>

<div class="grid-container-6">
  <div class="acess-text"><p id="title">Accessibility Testing</p><br> During the last part of my internship, I proposed new brand colours for the Arrival Advisor app based off edge case users. I looked into researching colours that were associated with positive connotations and reccommended a gold and pastel blue tone variation. These colours hues where chosen out of consideration for those who may be affected by colour vision and that worked well with both black and white text under the WCAG 2.0 web contrast standards.  </div>

At the end of my internship term, I participaed in one user testing session at Burnaby Family life and discovered interesting insights into the perspective of the app's audience who do not speak English natively and how they approach navigating through the app. </div>
