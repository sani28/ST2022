  <div class="bio"> <p id="title"> Intro </p> Initially researching designers and preparing strategic interview workflows during the pre field season, we also did extensive research into crafting narratives on the history of Dutch Design to its current state. During our field school, I conducted an interview with Valentin Loellmann and was the b-roll camera operator and on set assit for our art director.  In post field, I worked closely with the visual/interaction design team to develop the website interactions and collaborated with our video editing and content strategy team to structure the narrative of Valentin Loellmann's interview. Through a rigorous and divergent experimental design process, we created time capsule that uniquely reflected our field school experiences, the design interviews, and the memories we created as a group.  </div>

  <div class="ix-blurb"> <p id="title"> Scramble Effect + Mouse Hover </p> After much exploration on the interactions and visual deisgn team, a solidification was made in the intention to have an exploratory landing page. During this process, I implemented a scramble GSAP interaction and a mouse hover "enlarger" effect as the main micro interaction for this piece. The mouse hover preview images are reinforced throughout our website to encourage exploration - see <a href="#image-hovers">more</a> </div>
  <div class="ix-2"></div>
  <div class="ix-2-blurb"><p id="title">Credit Scroll, Navigation and Preview Interaction</p> For our team page, a credit scroll with imagery was proposed for the final interaction. I was able to tackle it with a marquee jQuery framework and set up the responisve layout as well. In the navigation system, I worked within a set grid constraint to create a circular style menu that caters to a holistic navigation style for the website.

  <div class="ix-3"></div>
  <div class="ix-blurb-3"><p id="title">Legacy</p> Initially inspired by talks of a "bookshelf" archive in our team discussions, one of the main interactions immedietly solidified for a legacy page was the ability to glimpse into the visual branding of all our previous field school years. Early interactive prototypes were created to a vertical format in opposition to a less intutive horizontal scroll, but was scrapped after testing that the visual design deemed to work better both functionally and visually on a horizontal plane.

    <div class="title-2"> <p id="valentin-title">Valentin Loellmann Interview </p> <p id="description"> With this interview, I approached asking questions around documenting his most recent studio work and its relation to his past seasonal furniture. For this narrative, I felt that it was important to capture the current state of his mind as his products are deeply reflective of his emotions and enviornments. Documenting him in a way that was organic and honest to his character was equally vital. I also wanted to tie his hobbies, interests and upbringing in an artistic family into how it has influenced his works. In admiration for the way he carries his energy and feelings into a one of kind form, I was also in awe by the depth of his craft and deep philosophy of life. I was honoured to have been able to create a story for him in this time and space and my desire for this narrative is to open up new perspectives into more abstract ideas around art and design. <br><br> </div>
