  <div class="bio"> <p id="title">Intro </p> Working alongside an enthusastic 11 member marketing team, I was able to learn to manage my work flow in a face paced, high tech environment.  During my time here, I primarily worked on creating PayByPhone's global brand value iconography, social media assets (including docmentation, video and photography), as well as various internal/external visual commuincation visuals, signages and launch packages. I also had the chance to animate some B2B and social media videos and proposed new web interactions for optimizing  their mobile landing pages on an Unbounce platform.    </div>

  <div class="img-1"> <p id="title">Campaign Assets</p> I created various campaign materials for city launches such as Seattle, Gatineau and Vancouver. This included animated videos for IG story, social posts and website content.  </div>
  <div class="img-2"> <p id="title">Social Media</p> As the main visual lead for social media <a href="https://www.instagram.com/paybyphone/">@paybyphone</a>, I worked closely with our marketing coordinators to reach target goals for social media growth and engagement. I created "PBP City Highlights" for Instagram Stories to promote parking lot numbers with nearby attractions, food places and activites. I also created videos and images for social media including giveaways, how to park videos, promotional video animations and other IG story content. </div>

  <div class="text"> <p id="title"> Brand Values </p> Much effort went into the final visuals that were to represent the company's new global brand values. From a proposal of 3 different art directions from the deisgn team, my iconography was selected to be used on postcards, swag and other employee materials for the launch of the brand values. I was happy to see the brand try new things and shift from a standard 2d icon style into illustative imagery with human scenes and figures. It was an interesting challenge to depict accurate meanings of the brand words - coming up with scenes, focusing on minute details of the people, their gestures or actions and how people percieved them. </div>

  <div id="career-compass-text"> Proceedingly, I created more iconography that aligned with the new brand imagery for PayByPhone's career compass program. This was also reflected into a new career page redesign where I assisted in the layout design and photography. </div>
